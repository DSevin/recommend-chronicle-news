Chevrons lose t20i series opener in bangladesh,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chevrons-lose-t20i-series-opener-in-bangladesh/,"ZIMBABWE senior men’s national cricket team got off their tour of Bangladesh to a poor start following an eight wickets defeat in the first T20I of the five-match series at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattorgram on Friday evening. After they were asked to bat first, the Chevrons had a disastrous batting show before Clive Madande and Wellington Masakadza brought back some sanity to see them finish on 124 runs all out in 20 overs. Despite a couple of rain delays, the Tigers managed to comfortably chase down the target in 15,2 overs, finishing on 126/2. The Chevrons had the worst possible start to the match, losing an early wicket of veteran Craig Ervine for a two-ball duck in the third over with the team on 8/1. Debutant, Joylord Gumbie was the next to fall for 17 runs off 14 balls after a 28-run second wicket partnership with Brian Bennett, who was run out two balls later on 16 runs after facing 15 deliveries. After losing the top order for just 36 runs in 5,1 overs, captain Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams and Ryan Burl failed to come to the party, all falling for golden ducks in quick succession. Zimbabwe found themselves in trouble on 38/6 in just 6,2 overs. However, gallant knocks from Madande and Masakadza made sure that the Chevrons breach the 100-run mark. Madande fell one run short of equaling his career best score in T20I as he was bowled on 43 runs from 39 balls while Masakadza made 34 runs off 38 deliveries. Madande, Masakadza, Gumbie and Bennett were the only Zimbabwean batters that managed to cross double figures with the rest failing to score more than three runs. Taskin Ahmed and Mohammad Saifuddin did the damage with the ball for the hosts, taking three wickets apiece for 14 and 15 runs respectively both in four overs. After a disastrous batting display, errors continued into the second innings of the match with the Chevrons being sloppy on the field. They dropped catches while also having misfields in a match that they were defending a below par score. There was a slight rain in the third over of the match’s second innings with Bangladesh on 10/1 after three overs. There was yet a second rain delay with Bangladesh needing 81 runs to win in 76 balls. Play managed to resume and no overs were lost and the Tigers managed to easily cruise to victory. The only two wickets that fell were taken by Blessing Muzarabani and Luke Jongwe.Bangladesh’s debutant, Tanzid Hasan was dropped three times and went on to punish the Chevrons with an unbeaten 67 runs off 47 balls. Towhid Hridoy also finished unbeaten on 33 runs off 18 balls while Najmul Hossain Shanto fell for 21 runs from 24 deliveries. The second match of the series is scheduled for Sunday at the same venue.

Bindura nickel corporation latest shares halted from trading on vfex,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/bindura-nickel-corporation-latest-shares-halted-from-trading-on-vfex/,"Nqobile Bhebhe, nqobile.bhebhe@chronicle.co.zw Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) shares are no longer trading on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange Limited as of today, a day\xa0 after the company was placed under reconstruction yesterday. The Government Gazette General Notice 523A of 2024, issued on May 2, 2024, announced the reconstruction. In a statement today, VFEX CEO, Mr Justin Bgoni said VFEX has engaged and agreed with Bindura Nickel mine\xa0 that the latter will make an application for voluntary suspension of trading of its securities on VFEX. “The Victoria Falls Stock Exchange Limited (“VFEX”) hereby notifies the investing public that a trading halt has been instituted in the trading of Bindura Nickel Corporation Limited shares on the VFEX with effect from Friday, 03 May 2024,” said Mr Bgoni. “This follows a notice of reconstruction which has been issued in the Government Gazette General Notice 523A of 2024 issued on 2nd of May 2024. “The reconstruction order is in relation to Trojan Nickel Mine Limited which is the major asset owned by Bindura Nickel Corporation Limited.” Following the implementation of the halt, investors will not be able to buy or sell Bindura Nickel Corporation Limited’s shares during the period the halt is in effect. The mining house was listed on VFEX in 2021. It is the first VFEX-listed entity to have its shares halted on the bourse. On Thursday, the nickel company cautioned that ongoing low nickel prices, high input costs—particularly electrical expenses—substantial mining depth, and low resource grade persist in negatively impacting its operations. It noted that despite the completion of the Sub-Vertical Rock (SVR) Project, which caused a temporary shutdown of BNC’s Trojan Nickel Mine (TNM) from September 22, 2023, the company continues to encounter various challenges that are expected to cause delays in the resumption of mining activities at TNM. In the trading update for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, the company emphasized that nickel prices remain subdued in the global markets, reaching economically unsustainable levels for the business. Internationally, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange witnessed a notable decline, attributed to market surplus conditions resulting from increased production in China and Indonesia coinciding with subdued global demand. However, a reconstruction order was issued yesterday. In issuing the reconstruction order under section 4 of the Reconstruction of State-Indebted Insolvent Companies Act [Chapter 24:27] (No. 27 of 2004), Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi, appointed Ms Mutsa Mollie Jean Remba as the administrator.

Finance company opens branch in bulawayo,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/finance-company-opens-branch-in-bulawayo/,"Sikhulekelani Moyo, mskhuekelani16@gmail.com YAMBUKAI Finance has opened a new branch in Bulawayo, which is meant to support the growth of the city’s economy through supporting different sectors including the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) The new branch is the company’s 11th since its establishment in 2000. The company, which has three branches in Harare and others in different towns and cities across the country said the new branch which is in the southern part of the country is meant to service the region after realising that there is a lot of development, which is happening across the region. In an interview during the grand opening of the branch in Bulawayo Yambukai Finance managing director Mr Alex Muzvondiwa said the microfinance company has ridden a lot of storms which include the 2003 and 2008 hyperinflation and the 2019 change of currency. He, however, said in 2021 the company partnered with the LOLC, a largest diversified conglomerate from Sri Lanka which has operations in more than 30 countries in different sectors, which include microfinance, insurance, banking, leisure and in manufacturing. “This Bulawayo branch is the 11th one that we have opened. We have three branches in Harare, one in Chitungwiza, another one in Mutare, Marondera, Masvingo, Gweru, Kwekwe and in Gokwe and plans are still afoot to establish more branches. “Why Bulawayo? As you know Bulawayo is a second largest city so it just makes sense to have representation here and Zimbabwe is made up of two major languages which is Ndebele and Shona so we felt our representation in this region was not strong and we want to be a national institution by covering every part of the country,” said Mr Muzvondiwa. “There are a lot of commercial activities that are happening in Bulawayo including the growing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) so, we would want to provide a helpline in times of need even for those SMEs.” Yambukai Finance offers short and medium term loans which include, salary-based loans, business loans which include order financing, assets-based loans and insurance-based loans among others. Mr Muzvondiwa said their company is also trying to demystify the microfinance sector where he said the company is operating within Government laws and regulations with reasonable interest rates and proper collection processes and adhering to client protection principles. In his presentation during the launch, Bulawayo Chamber of SMEs co-ordinator Mr Nketa Mangoye Dlamini said Bulawayo as a province is trying to develop and grow the SMEs sector, therefore there is need for companies that offer finance services for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). “Our belief is that when you come into the finance space, you are going to assist us, the SMEs and other individuals who have large corporates. “We have been crying access to finance but I think the trick is access to reasonable priced finance to say yes there is money but I shouldn’t get it at exorbitant rates because the issue is to get the money, we use it and we develop our companies from micro to small to medium and then to large corporates,” said Mr Dlamini. “That will be better for Bulawayo as an economy. On behalf of all SMEs and other friends, we welcome you to the City of Kings.” — @SikhulekelaniM1"
Delta corporation launches smart drinking and moderation innovation challenge,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/delta-corporation-launches-smart-drinking-and-moderation-innovation-challenge/,"Chronicle Writer GIANT beverages producer, Delta Corporation Limited, has joined hands with The Boost Fellowship to launch the ‘Smart Drinking and Moderation Innovation Challenge’ initiative, which runs from April 2024 to December 2026 under the theme ‘Above the Influence’. The two organisations held a Leadership Bootcamp in Harare between 14 to 17 April 2024, which was attended by 106 Enactus Zimbabwe student leaders from 13 different universities in Zimbabwe. Delta Corporation said it launched the programme in a bid to curb drug, substance and alcohol abuse among the youth. According to a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) approximately 12 percent of adolescents aged between 10-19 years in Zimbabwe engage in heavy episodic drinking and abuse different illegal substances, which is detrimental to their health and wellbeing. The initiative is meant to raise awareness about the risk and consequences of alcohol, drug and substance abuse among young people in Zimbabwe with an aim to eliminate the harmful impact caused by the challenge on the country’s youthful populace, said the company. The boot camp has paved way for capacity building of students on different topics that will help them implement their initiatives such as supporting legislative framework and how to run effective advocacy and awareness campaigns in communities on the negative impacts of alcohol and drug abuse. “We have learnt a lot about the results of alcohol abuse which includes gang violence, dropping out of school, suicides, gender-based violence and risky sexual behaviour among other things, and we are ready to go on and share the knowledge with our colleagues at school,” said Wisdom Munemo a student from the Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University. Speaking at the official launch of the Smart Drinking and Moderation Innovation Challenge on the 4th day of the boot camp, Delta Corporation general manager corporate affairs, Patricia Murambinda, said her organisation believes that the harmful use of alcohol is bad for communities and that university hubs as leading innovators should help solve the scourge of drug, substance, and alcohol abuse in communities. “As a responsible business we believe in the wellness of our consumers, we believe that when you drive you should not drink and that consumers should understand why and how alcohol should be consumed within the limits,” she said. “It’s our collective responsibility as youths to proffer solutions in our respective communities, particularly on the harmful effects of illicit substance and drug abuse. “We are investing in this program to witness high impact and scalable innovation solutions to address the problem,” said Murambinda. Tinoda Moyo, a social media expert encouraged the students to use social media and relevant technological solutions to campaign and advocate for better and safer communities for the youth while also proffering preventive measures highlighting the power of social media as a tool for behavioural change in today’s society that is tech savvy. Speaking at the event, Sergeant Muringwa, representing the Zimbabwe Republic Police encouraged the students to report incidents in their communities and work hand in hand with law enforcement agents in tacking the challenge of drug, substance and alcohol abuse. “I would like to urge all students present at this launch to work hand in hand with our law enforcement agents in your respective areas and to not take the law into your own hands,” he said. “You are our watchdogs in your residential areas and we look forward to partnering with you on this very noble campaign launched by Delta Corporation Limited in partnership with The Boost Fellowship.” Unveiling the 2024 thematic focus, the students were tasked with developing innovative projects that will help in fighting drug, substance and alcohol abuse initiatives aligned to six thematic areas that include illicit drinking, drinking, and driving, alcohol and pregnancy, binge drinking, underage drinking and sugary drinks and health. The teams will run awareness campaigns and roll out innovative models to address drug, substance and alcohol abuse in their tertiary institutions and communities for a maximum of eight months. Their final initiatives will be adjudicated in December 2024 at the Smart Drinking and Moderation Innovation Challenge Competition for further upscaling and Investment courtesy of Delta Corporation Limited."
Zimplow holdings mealie brand capacitation project progressing well expects new equipment,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimplow-holdings-mealie-brand-capacitation-project-progressing-well-expects-new-equipment/,"Business Writer Zimplow Holdings Limited, a leading farm implements manufacturer listed on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange says its Mealie Brand’s business unit capacitation project is progressing well, with new equipment expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of the year. The project aims to enhance factory efficiencies and capabilities, enabling the business unit to broaden its product range for agricultural implements and mining consumables. Acting CEO Mr Willem Swan emphasizes the importance of the initiative as a cornerstone for the business’s sustainability and future profitability Despite the business unit’s revenue for the period ending December 31, 2023, being nine percent lower than the prior year, the setback is attributed to reduced export sales volumes resulting from the proliferation of a cheaper product from Asia. However, the strategic capacitation project remains poised to drive positive outcomes in the near term. “The launch of the two-wheel tractor and related implements during the period under review resulted in local sales revenue being at par with prior year. Implements sold in the local market were 23 percent\xa0 ahead of prior year whilst exports were subdued by 24 percent. The Business Unit’s (BU) revenue was nine percent\xa0 below prior year owing to lower export sales volumes due to the proliferation of a cheaper product from Asia” ” The BU has been following through on refining and reviewing the supply chain as well as production efficiencies to reduce the cost of production of the plough. In addition, the Business Unit has progressed well with the capacitation project with the new equipment expected to be commissioned in Q3 of FY2024. “The capacitation project is expected to result in improved factory efficiencies and increased capabilities as the BU seeks to expand its product offering for both agricultural implements and mining consumables. This initiative is expected to anchor the business’ sustainability and profitability in the near future.” The tight liquidity crunch and the late rains during the 2023/24 cropping season significantly impacted Farmec performance, with tractor units and service hours sold being 37 percent below the comparable period. Mr Swan noted that Farmec is at an advanced stage towards the introduction of a comprehensive financing solution with a local financial institution for the benefit of its existing and prospective customers. “Furthermore, the BU is following through on demand management through refining its supply chain.” At Valmec which was officially launched on 29 September 2023, six tractors and ninety-two implements were sold in the period under review. Management is confident that the Business Unit will be able to reach the alternate target market which was previously unattended to by existing Group BU’s through brand visibility and awareness initiatives. Powermec Generator unit sales in the period under review were six percent ahead of prior year underpinned by the erratic power supply experienced in Q1 and Q3 of 2023. However, Mr Swan said service hours and parts revenue were subdued by 20 percent in comparison to the same period in the prior year due to reduced call-outs during the period when power was stable. Powermec is set to capitalize on the effects of the El Nino induced drought which is expected to witness severe power cuts through stock availability\xa0 and buttressed by a healthy order pipeline. CT Bolts CT Bolts’ revenue was at the same level as prior year, while tonnage volume sales were depressed by six percent mainly due to the sales mix. Pressure on margins and operating costs weighed down the operating profit by 83 percent compared to prior year. Mr Swan noted that the Division is implementing various business development and growth initiatives targeted at the mining sector through collaboration with Mealie Brand’s capabilities through its capacitation project. “The Division has also invested in the local production of nails and other related products to support the infrastructure and construction sector.” Going forward, the Group expects to face headwinds in FY2024 as a result of the El Nino induced drought and the corresponding downstream effect and the impact of the soft mineral prices resulting in mines retreating or delaying expansion and capital expenditure spending. However, he said the Group is insulating itself from the effects of these macro-economic factors. “Management is confident that through executing its factory capacitation, the successful launch of the newly acquired OEM’s, the strategic business turnaround of the loss making entities as well as embarking on a Group-wide cost containment program, it will show commendable growth in revenue generation and profitability in 2024.”"

The summit is held in the industrial hub of South Africa – Zimbabwe’s major trading partner and logical springboard into the country. The summit runs from today to tomorrow. In his forward statement, Prof Ncube said the summit is a culmination of years of preparation by many, who toiled tirelessly to tell the story of Zimbabwe and the opportunities it o\xaders to the region and the world. “The conception of the investment summit has borrowed heavily from the National Development Strategy 1: 2021-2025 (NDS1) agenda, and its foundation ambition to spur Zimbabwe to an upper middle-income country by 2030. “Over the next two days, various speakers and I will unpack different perspectives on the challenges and nascent opportunities prevalent in Zimbabwe,” Prof Ncube. “A key member of our presenting parties, namely ZIDA – our government agency for investment promotion – will illustrate practical steps to follow when seeking to explore the numerous opportunities presented by Zimbabwe. “I urge you to take the opportunity of the next two days to interrogate the story we have to tell; engage with the speakers both in plenary and in one-on-one sessions to get beyond the dry numbers that will be presented. “Typical of many of my countrymen, you will find that Zimbabweans present here today, whether in the private or public spheres are warm, engaging, hardworking, honest and highly knowledgeable people. I trust you will agree that these are the sort of human attributes you would wish to partner with in making your investment foray into Zimbabwe a successful journey,” he added. According to the summit programme, there will be presentations on the launch of the country’s ZIG currency, plenary presentations with a focus on finance and the energy sector, an outline of challenges and opportunities in mining and insights on how Zimbabwe is building its tourism offerings."
Zedcon 2024 to tackle climate change,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zedcon-2024-to-tackle-climate-change/,"Business Writer The upcoming Zimbabwe Economic Development Conference (ZEDCON) 2024, scheduled for September, will prominently feature discussions on climate-proofing the economy, enhancing resilience, and propelling economic transformation in the face of climate change, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has said. The pivotal conference aims to foster innovative strategies and collaborative efforts to navigate the challenges posed by environmental shifts. The annual conference organised by the Finance Ministry will be held in Victoria Falls from 14 to 18 September under the theme “Building Resilience and Driving Economic Transformation under Climate Change.” It is expected to explore strategies for climate-proofing the economy, building resilience and driving economic transformation under the impact of climate change. Earlier this month, President Mnangagwa declared a nationwide State of Disaster in response to the severe drought triggered by the El Niño weather phenomenon. The proclamation underscores the critical urgency for implementing effective measures and interventions to mitigate the dire impact of climate change The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) indicated that the 2023/24 cropping season would be characterised by erratic and low rainfall patterns due to the El Niño weather prompting all stakeholders to push for the adoption of measures that will lessen the impact of the impending climate challenge. El Nino, which causes oceans to warm, usually triggers drier weather in southern Africa, reducing crop yields and pushing temperatures higher. La Nina, which usually follows El Nino periods, results in the opposite. The Ministry of Finance has initiated preparations for the upcoming conference, and they are actively soliciting abstract submissions from a diverse range of contributors. Researchers, academia, economic think tanks, and development partners are invited to share their insights and expertise. The collaborative effort will enrich the discourse, fostering innovative solutions and informed strategies The objective of ZEDCON 2024 is to bring together researchers, academics, development partners, corporates, economic think tanks and representative organizations to share knowledge, experiences and best practices on how to build resilience and drive economic transformation in the face of climate change. The conference will focus on climate-proofing agricultural production and growth, climate-proofing and achieving energy self-sufficiency and public-private partnerships to finance climate resilience and transformative programmes. Other key pillars are meteorological analysis of climate variability, rainfall patterns and El Nino effects 2025-2030 and beyond. Last year’s conference was held under the theme: “Public and Private Resource Mobilisation for Sustainable Development.” During the inaugural conference in 2022, topics tackled included the role of capital markets in the development of the country, retaining human capital retention for national development and fiscal incentives and economic sustainability of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Zimbabwe, among others."
Zimplats retrench 67 in april,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimplats-retrench-67-in-april/,"Nqobile Bhebhe,nqobile.bhebhe@chronicle.co.zw Zimbabwe’s top platinum group metals producer,Zimplats , terminated 67 employees in April, which is 1,6 percent of the total permanent workforce due to financial strain caused by a significant drop in global platinum prices. In a memo dated 18 March, CEO Mr Alex Mhembere announced the initiation of a “voluntary retrenchment exercise for all interested employees.” The objective of the program is to “avoid the need for mandatory retrenchments.” The company foresees that the subdued prices of platinum group metals will persist for the next 12 to 18 months. Given this prolonged period of low prices, the company saw it fit to implement further cost-cutting measures. In a quarterly report for the period ended March 31, the mining house noted that due to the decrease in metal prices, the management has taken steps to preserve cash which involve adjusting labor rationalisation and rescheduling capital projects within financial limitations. “In April 2024, 67 employees, being 1,6 percent of total permanent workforce were retrenched.” It noted that containment initiatives implemented in the prior quarter progressed in the period under review, resulting in a two percent reduction in total operating cash costs from the prior quarter. “Operating cash costs increased by seven percent year-on-year, primarily due to the nine percent and seven percent increase in mining and milling volumes respectively, benefitting from cost mitigation efforts which helped contain the impact of persistent input inflation. “Transfers from stocks to operating costs amounted to US$2,8 million during the period, in line with the movement in inventory across the value chain.” Cash costs of metal produced increased by five percent and one percent from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. Operating cash unit cost of US$821 per 6E ounce was marginally below that of the prior quarter and declined by six percent year-on-year, benefitting from volume gains which offset inflationary pressures experienced on electricity. The mining house noted that a total of US$340 million has been spent to date on the smelter expansion and SO2 abatement plant against a total project budget of US$521 million A further US$27 million has been spent on the implementation of the 35MW solar plant project against a budget of US$37 million. Added to that, a total of US$27 million has been spent to date on the execution of the Base Metal Refinery refurbishment project, against a total budget of US$190 million. Mining volumes were unchanged from prior quarter but increased by nine percent year-on-year benefitting from the pillar reclamation operations at Rukodzi Mine and the continued ramp-up of production from Mupani Mine, which is under development. Pillar reclamation activities also benefitted 6E head grade, which was two percent higher year-on-year. The one reduction in grade from the prior quarter was due to an increased contribution of lower-grade Mupani Mine development ore and dilution from mining across geological structures. Milled volumes increased by seven percent and three from the comparative and prior quarter, respectively. It noted that a scheduled reline of the mills at the Selous Metallurgical Complex (SMC) was deferred to the fourth quarter of FY2024, the volumes from which also benefitted from improved milling rates and running time, in line with higher ore supply. Concentrate recoveries were stable versus the prior quarter and increased by five percent from the comparative quarter, resulting in a two percent quarter-on-quarter and 14 percent year-on-year increase in the volume of 6E in concentrate produced. 6E metal in final product improved by 12 percent year-on-year and was one percent higher than the prior quarter."
National railways of zimbabwe sees huge potential in partnerships,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/national-railways-of-zimbabwe-sees-huge-potential-in-partnerships/,"Prosper Ndlovu, Chronicle Writer THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has embraced an “open access business model” that is anchored on harnessing more business through strategic partnerships, as part of efforts to grow revenue and facilitate enhanced capital investments to improve business efficiencies. Public affairs and stakeholder relations manager, Mr Andrew Kunambura, said as part of the company’s transformative strategies, NRZ was ready to work closely with key private sector players. He said securing strategic synergies was critical in boosting business capacity and promote smooth logistics, which also promotes enhanced trade relations. “NRZ, in the short to medium terms has come up with an open access model, which attracts private sector players in the provision of locomotives and wagons, which are currently inadequate,” said Mr Kunambura in a recent interview. “We are envisioning ourselves improving in terms of business efficiencies and boosting our revenue as we are able to attract more business and then plough back the income generated towards improving our railway system and improve on delivery times to meet all customer requirements and expectations.” As Zimbabwe positions itself as a favourable investment destination, coupled with the resurgent increase in domestic production mainly in mining, manufacturing and agriculture sectors, among others, Mr Kunambura said NRZ was geared to deliver efficient bulk transport services within the country and beyond. Mr Andrew Kunambura He said given Zimbabwe’s central geographical location within the Southern region, the NRZ network, which closely links with the vital north and south corridor and east and west corridors, makes the company a key player in facilitating trade between local businesses and export markets. “Partnership is the way to go and synergies are critical in improving efficiencies,” said Mr Kunambura. A wholly-owned Government entity, NRZ is geographically positioned as the hub and gateway to the region of Southern Africa Development Community (Sadc). For instance, NRZ and Mozambique are linked through Mutare/Machipanda border posts to Beira as well as Sango/Tshikwalakwala that goes to Maputo. South Africa is linked through Beitbridge, Botswana is connected via Plumtree and Victoria Falls to Zambia. NRZ was one of the top local companies that exhibited their diverse products and services at the recent Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in Bulawayo. The premier trade expo also attracted huge foreign participation in response to improved ease of doing business facilitated by the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa."
Econet breakthrough launch,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/econet-breakthrough-launch/,"Chronicle Writer ZIMBABWE’S largest telecommunications and technology company, Econet Wireless, has achieved an Africa first by opening two free remittance corridors into the country, completely eliminating the cost to both sender and receiver. Econet has partnered with its sister company, Sasai Money Transfer, to enable individuals and companies in the United Kingdom and South Africa to send money into Zimbabwe free of charge, starting today, said the company. Under this framework, the receiver also cashes out of their EcoCash wallet for free. Normally, international remittances attract a charge of up to 15 percent for the sender, while the receiver is charged about three percent when cashing-out. Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive officer, Dr Douglas Mboweni, said that the latest decision is aimed at helping Zimbabweans to weather the acute challenges caused by the drought. The country recently declared a national disaster over a drought caused by the El Niño climatic weather patterns, which has left more than 2,7 million people in need of food aid. “We hope Zimbabweans in the Diaspora will use the savings to send more money home to their families,” Dr Mboweni said. “The majority of remittances to Zimbabwe are conducted through these two main corridors (the UK and South Africa). “We don’t have to pay any third parties on those corridors, because we rely on a sister company in the group, which agreed to help out,” he said. Dr Mboweni said he hopes the move by Econet will encourage other companies facilitating remittances into Zimbabwe to reduce their fees, noting that it was time that remittances into Africa in general were brought down “to assist with the continent’s economic development agenda”. Dr Douglas Mboweni He added that the initiative was in support of Government efforts to increase Diaspora remittances coming into the country through formal channels. Dr Mboweni said Econet’s extensive EcoCash agent network ensures that even people in remote rural areas have access to low-cost financial services, reducing the need for recipients to travel long distances to collect cash. The company has said its remittance transfers will be facilitated through the EcoCash US dollar wallet service using registered Econet lines."
Milk production rises,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/milk-production-rises/,"Business Writer Zimbabwe’s milk production rose 21 percent to 27,3 million litres during the first quarter of 2024 from 22,61 million litres in the same period last year, the latest data shows. It comes as the Zimbabwe Association for Dairy Farmers (ZADF) is expecting reduced feedstocks in the form of roughage (maize silage) and protein sources due to the effects of the El Nino-induced drought, which will affect national milk production and productivity. Statistics from the Agriculture Ministry’s Dairy Services Department, show that the country’s milk intake by processors went up 21 percent in the first quarter of 2024 to 25,07 million litres from 20,74 million litres in the comparative period. Retail milk production increased by 19 percent to 2,22 million litres in the first quarter of 2024, compared to 1,86 million litres in the first quarter of 2023. Average milk output for the period under review stood at 9,1 million litres. In the first quarter of 2023, the country’s average milk output stood at 7,53 million litres. In March this year, the country’s milk production appreciated by 19 percent to 8,96 million litres, compared to 7,51 million litres in March last year. At 8,96 million litres in March 2024, milk production was up two percent from 8,81 million litres recorded in February this year. January milk output of 9.52 million litres is the highest so far. The annual milk requirement stands at about 120 million litres and the country has been supplementing through imports. Zimbabwe’s milk production rose nine percent to 99,82 million litres in 2023 from 91,39 million litres in 2022. However, it was forecasted to reach 100 million litres, a 7,5 percent increase in milk output when compared with 2022, but slightly below the set target of 103 million litres for 2023. This surge in production can be attributed to strategic interventions by the government, particularly the implementation of the Presidential Silage Inputs Scheme. It was designed to enhance the quality and quantity of livestock feed and has played a pivotal role in transforming the dairy landscape. The programme provides farmers with subsidised silage inputs, ensuring a consistent and nutritious diet for dairy cows, ultimately contributing to increased milk yields. The silage production programme is to address viability challenges emanating from high-feed costs as the dairy sector is saddled by huge overhead costs headlined by stockfeed, which accounts for 70 percent of the bill. The success of the silage inputs scheme can be merged with the European Union’s US$7 million funding facility to Zimbabwe, which benefitted small-to-medium-scale dairy farmers in the form of 500 in-calf heifers in 2021 under the Transforming Zimbabwe’s Dairy Value Chain project. This has seen the rising number of dairy cows being actively milked across the country. Currently, approximately 35,000 dairy cows are contributing to the increased production levels, showcasing the tangible results of these agricultural initiatives. The interventions were part of the country’s Livestock Recovery and Growth Plan, with a deliberate effort to increase the national dairy herd from 19\xa0000 in 2021 to 40\xa0000 in 2025. – Business Weekly."
Governments emphasis on infrastructural development spurs tourism group on,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/governments-emphasis-on-infrastructural-development-spurs-tourism-group-on/,"Nqobile Bhebhe, nqobile.bhebhe@chronicle.co.zw Rainbow Tourism Group (RTG), a prominent player in the hospitality industry, is buoyed by the Government’s emphasis on infrastructural development saying it is crucial for boosting tourism and improving inter-city travel. In a statement accompanying the group’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, RTG board chairperson, Douglas Hoto said the investment in strong infrastructure not only aids the hospitality sector but also spurs overall growth and connectivity. The hospitality group adds that it has demonstrated agility by consistently refining its business model and leveraging technology has been a key strategy to enhance operational efficiency and foster deeper engagement with customers. “Our ability to adapt swiftly to these conditions has been pivotal. We have remained agile, continuously refining our business model and leveraging technology to boost operational efficiency and deepen our engagement with customers. “The outlook remains positive. We draw encouragement from the Government of Zimbabwe’s focus on infrastructural development, which is fundamental in fostering tourism and enhancing inter-city travel.” Mr Hoto said the 2024 revenue forecasts point toward a robust performance, fuelled by the recovery of regional and international business. Notably, domestic business has demonstrated consistency even after the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group anticipates significant benefits from the growth of leisure tourism in the Victoria Falls market and national conferencing activities. Volumes are projected to improve city hotels’ accommodation and conferencing activities. “Domestic business has proved to be consistent post-Covid-19 pandemic and is anticipated to grow driven by the national infrastructure development projects being rolled out by the Government of Zimbabwe. “The Group can reap significant benefits from the growth of leisure tourism in the Victoria Falls market and national conferencing activities. Volumes are projected to improve for city hotels, accommodation and conferencing activities. The Company will explore collaborations with partners to unlock shareholder value, leveraging strategic alliances and innovative partnerships to drive sustainable growth.” Mr Hoto said RTG is poised to explore strategic collaborations and innovative partnerships. These endeavours aim to unlock shareholder value, foster sustainable growth and strengthen RTG’s competitive standing in the market. During the period under review, the Group witnessed a substantial increase in foreign currency business. The increase was driven by regional and international business, which together grew by 129 percent. Resort hotels experienced a notable performance improvement, with occupancy increasing by 44 percent to 52 percent in 2023 from 36 percent in 2022. City hotels, despite recording increased revenues, posted lower occupancy, primarily due to the reduced amount of business activity during the first half of the year. The Group maintained its gross profit margin at 72 percent over the past two years, which is within the industry benchmarks. The gross margins were achieved despite a year-on-year inflation rate of 314 percent as of 31 December 2023 and gross margins were sustained through rigorous cost reduction initiatives aimed at mitigating the effects of escalating market prices and unstable foreign currency exchange rates."
Edgars invests us1m in new equipment,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/edgars-invests-us1m-in-new-equipment/,"Sikhulekelani Moyo, mskhulekelani16@gmail.com DESPITE relocating its headquarters from Bulawayo to Harare, Edgars Limited has made a significant investment in the industrialisation of Bulawayo, investing approximately US$1 million in new equipment and creating employment opportunities for 700 people in the city. The relocation of the headquarters allowed Edgars to focus on better oversight of its outlets. While Harare has 15 stores, Bulawayo has only four stores. Edgars group chief executive officer, Mr Sevious Mushosho said the move has enabled the company to invest more in its Bulawayo factory, which could become one of the largest factories in the city. Edgars has recruited people from other clothing factories and employed 400 people in Bulawayo last year and another 300 this year. Last year, the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange listed clothing retailer and manufacturer relocated its retail chain management offices from Bulawayo to Harare. Speaking during a plenary session in the recently held Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Business Luncheon on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF), Mr Mushosho said the relocation of the headquarters was after the realisation that Harare has many outlets that need day to day management as compared to only two outlets, which are in Bulawayo. “The Plumtree Road factory could be one of the biggest factories in Bulawayo. We have recruited people from other clothing line factories. We employed 400 people last year and a further 300 this year ,in Bulawayo,” he said. “So, in terms of industrialisation, Edgars is playing a leading role. What Edgars did was just to move head office staff to Harare, so that we have better oversight of what’s happening because if you look at it, in Harare we have 15 stores and four stores in Bulawayo.” Mr Mushosho noted that the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange Listed firm is actively addressing competition through innovative approaches. In Bulawayo, the company is expanding production and focusing on enhancing quality. To play a significant role in Bulawayo, Edgars has ordered machines worth US$1 million for installation at Carousel factory, to ramp up garment production from 35 000 units per month to 100 000 units per month before the end of the year.—@SikhulekelaniM1."
Trade deficit up 1178 percent,https://www.chronicle.co.zw/trade-deficit-up-1178-percent/,"Michelle Moyo, moyomichelle19@gmail.com THREE countries — South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and China accounted for approximately 79 percent of the total export value of US534,7 million in March while four countries accounted for 67 percent of the total import value of US$719,0 million, according to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency. Providing an update on external trade for March, the agency highlighted that the goods trade deficit hit US184,3 million, marking a 117,8 percent increase from the February deficit of US$84,6 million. A trade deficit occurs when a country’s value of imports is greater than that of exports in a given period. When the value of exports exceeds the value of imports, it implies a trade surplus. Exports during the period amounted to US534,7 million, a decrease of 17,1 percent (US$11,3 million) from the February figure of US$645,0 million. Imports totalled US719,0 million,which was 1,5 percent US$10,7 million) lower than the February imports of US$729,6 million. The agency reported that in March, major export destinations for the country included South Africa (34,6 percent), United Arab Emirates (34,3 percent) and China (10,4 percent). These three countries collectively represented approximately seventy-nine percent of the total export value of US$534,7 million. Regarding major source countries for imports, South Africa accounted for 38,5 percent, China for 15,1 percent, Bahamas (9,4 percent) and Mozambique for 3,9 percent. Together, these four countries made up around sixty-seven percent of the total import value of US$719,0 million. For March 2024, the total value of imports was US$719,0 million from which South Africa accounted for 38,5 percent. The agency noted that among the top 10 products exported in March were semi-manufactured gold, nickel mattes and tobacco, which accounted for 23,6 percent, 16,1 percent and 12,3 percent of the total value of US$534,7 million respectively. Mineral fuels and mineral oil products, machinery and mechanical appliances, cereals and vehicles were among the top ten imported products in March. Meanwhile, ZimStat has started reporting three sets of inflation data after the launch of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). Inflation data will now be presented in weighted format, with separate figures for US dollar and ZiG. “Going forward from the April price statistics, the country will publish three price indices with the ZiG index, US dollars Index and the Blended Index. This month we do not have a ZiG price index because it has been rebased according to international practice.” The US dollar Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 106,76 in April and 105,96 in March. In US dollars, month-on-month inflation rate was 0,8 percent in April gaining 0,6 percentage points on the March rate of 0,2 percent. The US dollar year-on-year inflation rate for April as measured by the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 3,2 percent. “This means that prices as measured by the all-items CPI, increased by an average of 3,2 percent between April 2023 and April 2024 giving us a mean month-on-month inflation rate for the period January to April 2024 of 0,1 percent,” Zimstat said. The year-on-year inflation rate for April as measured by the all-items CPI, was 57,5 percent, meaning that prices as measured by the all-items CPI, increased by an average of 57,5 percent between April 2023 and April. The weighted inflation mean month-on-month inflation rate for the period January to April 2024 was 4,9 percent. ZimStat could not compute the ZiG based inflation figures for March. “The ZiG CPI in April 2024 was 100,00. In April 2024, Zimbabwe introduced the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency. “Therefore, the index reference for the CPI for the ZiG currency is April 2024. This means during the month of April 2024, there is no month-on-month and year-on-year inflation rates. “The month-on-month inflation rate for the ZiG currency will be computed starting in May 2024 and going forward and year-on-year inflation rate will be computed in April 2025 and going forward according to the international recommended methods. — @Lo7246Lovelyn']"
